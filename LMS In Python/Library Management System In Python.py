Task:

Make A library Management System:

Steps:

1. Make 2 instance variables "books" and "no_of_books"

2. The "books" is an empty list.

3. The no_of_books is an integer equal to zero.

4. Make another instance method.

5. This instance method takes a new book as an argument and each time I call this function
   and pass a new argument it appends that argument to the books list.

6. Now Create a library for Library class( i.e : object reference ).

7. Now using that library print the number of books passed as an argument to the previous instance
   method by incrementing the value of the variable no_of_books.

8. Also print it using the length of the list of books.

9. Now print the all the books passed as an argument.
